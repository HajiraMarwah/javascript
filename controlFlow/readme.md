# ðŸ“Œ Control Flow in JavaScript

Control Flow determines the **order in which statements are executed** in a program.  
JavaScript executes code **line by line**, but control flow structures can alter this order.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Sequential Execution
By default, JavaScript executes statements **top to bottom**.

```js
let a = 5;
let b = 10;
let sum = a + b;
console.log(sum); // 15
```
## ðŸ”¹ 2. Conditional Statements
Conditional statements allow JS to make decisions.
   -  if Statement
   -  if-else Statement
   -  else if Ladder
   -  switch Statement
  
## ðŸ”¹ 3. Loops
       - for Loop
       - while Loop
       - do-while Loop
       - for...of Loop (Arrays / Iterables)
       - for...in Loop (Objects)

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Function Calls
Function calls change the control flow by jumping to the function and returning later.

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Break and Continue
    -  break â†’ exit a loop immediately.
    - continue â†’ skip the current iteration and continue with the next.

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Try-Catch (Error Handling)
   Control flow can also handle errors using try-catch-finally.
