# üåê Scope and Scope Chain in JavaScript  

In JavaScript, **scope** determines the **accessibility (visibility)** of variables.  
The **scope chain** defines how JavaScript resolves variables when they are not found in the current scope.

## üîπ What is Scope?  

Scope refers to the **current context of execution** where variables, functions, and objects are accessible.  

### Types of Scope in JavaScript  

1. **Global Scope**  
   - Variables declared outside any function or block.  
   - Accessible from **anywhere** in the code.  

2. **Function Scope (Local Scope)**  
   - Variables declared inside a function.  
   - Accessible **only within that function**.  

3. **Block Scope (ES6 ‚Äì let & const)**  
   - Variables declared with `let` or `const` inside `{}`.  
   - Accessible only within that block.  

4. **Lexical Scope**  
   - Inner functions can access variables defined in their **outer functions**.
